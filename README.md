"Titanic Dataset: From CSV to PyTorch Tensors for Neural Network Training"

This project demonstrates the process of loading the Titanic dataset, handling missing values, and converting the data into PyTorch tensors for neural network training.

1. Loading the Titanic Dataset
The Titanic dataset, which includes passenger details such as age, gender, and survival status, is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

2. Checking Data Integrity
After loading the dataset, we verify its integrity by checking the first and last rows. This ensures that the dataset has been loaded correctly and without errors.

3. Filtering Numeric Columns
The dataset contains both numeric and categorical data. To prepare for neural network processing, we filter to retain only the numeric columns, removing non-numeric data such as names and cabin information.

4. Handling Missing Values
Handling missing values is crucial for maintaining dataset integrity. We check for missing values using the isnull().sum() function and replace them with zeros (or other suitable values) using the fillna() function to avoid issues during model training.

5. Separating Features and Labels
We separate the features (x_data) and the labels (y_data). The "Survived" column serves as the label, while the remaining numeric columns are used as features for prediction.

6. What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is a popular machine learning library that supports tensor computations and deep learning. It provides a user-friendly environment for training neural networks with strong GPU acceleration.

7. What are Tensors?
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that are fundamental in deep learning. They store and process data efficiently, enabling operations like matrix multiplication.

8. Why Convert Data to Tensors?
To train machine learning models, datasets must be converted into tensors. Tensors allow efficient computations on both CPUs and GPUs, which is essential for deep learning training.

9. Converting Data to Tensors
The features (x_data) and labels (y_data) are converted into PyTorch tensors using the tensor() function.

10. Verifying the Conversion
Finally, we print the tensor values to confirm that the conversion was successful, ensuring that both features and labels are ready for training.

Conclusion
This project outlines the essential steps for preparing the Titanic dataset for neural networks in PyTorch, enabling efficient learning and prediction of outcomes such as passenger survival.
